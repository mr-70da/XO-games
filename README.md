1- Pyramic Tic-Tac-Toe
The game board is shaped like a pyramid. Five squares make the base, then three, then one. Players take turns marking Xs and Os as in traditional tic-tac-toe.
Winning: The first player to get three-in-a-row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins.
See two examples of winning positions, below.

2- Four-in-a-row
You will recognize four-in-a row as a two-dimensional version of the classic game, Connect Four. The game board consists of a 7 x 6 grid. Seven columns of six squares each. Instead of dropping counters as in Connect Four, players mark the grid with Xs and Os as in tic-tac-toe.
Rules: The first player places an X in the bottom square of any column. Taking turns, players make their mark in any column, as long as it is in the lowest square possible. See image below for an example of possible first six moves.
Winning: The first player to get four-in-a-row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins.
Example play for six moves of four-in-a-row

3- 5 x 5 Tic Tac Toe 
This tic-tac-toe variation is played on a 5 x 5 grid. As in the traditional game, players are Xs or Os.
Rules: Players take turns placing an X or an O in one of the squares until all the squares except one are filled. (Each player has 12 turns for a total of 24 squares.) 
Winning: Count the number of three-in-a-rows each player has. Sequences can be vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Whoever has the most, wins. Can one mark be counted in more than one three-in-a-row sequence? Decide ahead of time, yes or no. It is easier in implementation to allow counting more than once.
